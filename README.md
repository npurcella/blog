# blog

This is a simple little blog project I am doing from scratch. Nothing too fancy, just keeping my php skills up. 

It consists of the front page (accessed by *blog/*)and an admin section (accessed by *blog/admin/admin.php*).

The admin section allows a user with the correct admin credientials to add, edit and delete a blog entry. Title and Content are required, while an image is optional, and 16M maximum size. There is also a Publish checkbox that allows the user to select whether it will be displayed or not.

I am planning to make this site work on both desktop as well as mobile and tablet, as well as allow users to create and account and add comments.

Also planning to move the code into a framework; that may come sooner, still thinking about when that should happen.
